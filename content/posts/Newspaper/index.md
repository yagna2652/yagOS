It's a popular form of advertisement because it's an incredibly effective way to reach the customers you're targeting.Also, 30% of a nations population is not insignificant. In the U.S. that's about 100 million people.

I'll break it down a little further. Newspapers and magazines are in essence the same. It's text accompanied with pictures. Newspapers and magazines will often focus on writing about certain topics as it's easier. It requires less expertise and staff than if they choose to cover more topics.

The topics being written about will determine what kind of people they attract. We can assume that the readers of a certain type of magazine/newspaper share some common interests.

From a marketing viewpoint, grouping people by their interest (or needs) is possibly the best way to effectivly reach the people most likely to buy your products as people with similar interests tend to follow some similar patterns. They read the same things, watch the same things, go the same places, and/or talk to people with the same interests.

Now, if you have some accounting services you wish to sell, your target customers should be the people who need them, i.e. business owners. Getting your message across to as many business owners as possible without spending too much money is tricky. You start looking at where you might find the largest amount of business owners in one place. Some may listen to the radio, some may watch that one show on TV, but most of them will be reading Bloomberg or the NY Times business section. You could try to reach everyone by advertising on every radio station, tv channel, golf course, along every highway, etc., but cost would be astronomical - it just wouldn't be very effective. By simply advertising in the above-mentioned papers you would get a lot of exposure for every dollar spent.

Worth noting is that magazines and newspapers know quite a lot about their readers. If you wish to advertise your brand new car to men over 50 with a certain level of income and lifestyle, the publishers or other external entities will help you find the exact magazine (and also where in the magazine) your message will be best received
