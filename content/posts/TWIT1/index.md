This week in training, I have picked up momentum again. I highly recommend keeping momentum as a goal if you are not training for something specific. Because then you will be training to keep the ball rolling. You are stacking wins. Being consistently good is far better than being ocassionally great.

This week in training, I started doing a lot of pullups again. There is something so deeply rewarding about defeating inertia and repeatedly rising on days that it feels like earth is working to make you do just the opposite. 

This week in training, I have quit eating eggs. This has nothing to do with training. I realised today, my father considers eating eggs, a sin. And he was explicitly vocal about how I would let him down as a father if I ever chose to do so. And I would not be able to forgive myself for life, if I do so.

This week in training, I have realised how there is no unconditional love. Even your parents. I was talking to an extremly wise friend of mine on how parenting is also an act of selfishness. Our parents do not want to protect us, but a version of us that serves their sense of security in the world. They try to put their beliefs on us. This happens generation by generation. We go on giving our diseases; we go on infecting children with our ideas which have not proved valid in our own lives. It appears to me that parents, by virtue of the amount of time they spent on this planet, have lost belief that they can feel secure in this world. That their ambitions will ever be fullfilled. Their last bit of security is us. And when we grow up, if you like me are also rebellious, they start to lose their sense of security in us too. We might grow out of childhood, but parents never grow out of parenthood. How existentially terrifying it is to realise that there is no tree now whose shade would shelter your existential security.  This leaves me all confused, should I keep rebelling? or should I throw my weapons down and choose a life, they choose for me. The latter makes me want to commit suicide, and the first one is also not a satisfactory answer to me. But I will figure it out.

This week in training, I have reduced my screentime between workouts by 10%.
