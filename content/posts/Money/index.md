First you need to understand the basic of inflation. Currency and wealth are not the same thing. Currency is the representation of wealth to make trade easier.

Wealth is created all the time. I buy a 100$ axe to cut down tree and sell those three for 2000$. The lumber mill transform those tree into plank and sell those plank for 10k$. The builder use those plank to build an house that he can sell for 100k$. Wealth come from work and natural resources.

If wealth increase over time and you never print new currency, the law of supply and demand will do it thing. More wealth = people will want to trade that wealth more = people will need more currency to do those trade = the value of the currency increase. That's deflation.

Now in the past, economist view deflation as the cause of economic collapse. Since then, studies show that it's not really the case. A lot of deflation is bad, but deflation from time to time won't automatically create a recession. Still deflation can cause some problem in the long term. The ideal solution would be create enough currency to match exactly the new wealth created. That way, the value of the currency would stay stable. The problem is that it's impossible to achieve. We can't really estimate the exact amount of wealth created. So the question is do we target zero inflation and we risk to sometime have a bit of inflation and sometime a bit of deflation. Or do we target a bit of inflation or do we target a bit of deflation.

Which of these 3 solutions would be the best. Like I said, economist were sure that deflation was always bad, so the target was easy, the only way to make sure we get as little deflation as possible is to target a bit of inflation. The added benefice if that the central bank can control inflation with the interest rate. If there is too much inflation, increase the rate and the inflation should drop. If the inflation drop too much, decrease the rate and the inflation should go up. But you can't drop the interest rate below zero, so if we get into deflation, the central bank doesn't have much tools to combat it.

That's why, pretty much all country target a 2% inflation. Not too much that it become a problem for the economy and not low enough that the central bank doesn't have any tools to combat any problems.

Additionally, there is the point of view that a little bit of inflation incentivize investing your money, which create a more dynamic economy. While deflation incentivize keeping your money, which lead to less economic growth.
