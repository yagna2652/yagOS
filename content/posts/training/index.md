This week in training, I have picked up momentum again. I highly recommend keeping momentum as a goal, if you are not training for something specific. Because then you will be training to keep the ball rolling. You are stacking wins. Being consistently good is far better than being ocassionally great.

This week in training, I started doing a lot of pullups again. There is something so deeply rewarding about defeating inertia and repeatedly rising on days that it feels like earth is working to make you do just the opposite. 

This week in training, I have quit eating eggs. This has nothing to do with training. I realised today, my father considers eating eggs, a sin. And he was explicitly vocal about how I would let him down as a father if I ever chose to do so. And I would not be able to forgive myself for life, if I do so.
