In front of you lies a mountain. It is covered in trees, withered from a constant onslaught of treacherous wind, it is steep, and cold and unforgiving. Its canyons house razor sharp rocks. A wrong turn, a slip, a lack of vigilance, could bring disaster. Everyone has avoided this mountain for these reasons. And I want you to start climbing it.

There is always a mountain in front of us. The mountain is addiction. The mountain is underemployment. The mountain is loneliness. The mountain is waking up before 6am. The mountain is getting over your ex. The mountain is finally approaching that girl at the gym. The mountain is grief left in the wake of a lost spouse. The mountain is sometimes just realizing that you have grown too comfortable lately, and it’s time to re-learn what climbing feels like.

Whatever your mountain is, you are not climbing it right now, and you need to start. Why? Because what you are doing now, standing in place, being afraid, thinking about how you might one day summit, but not today, is not living. It’s purgatory, while everything and everyone passes you by, in order to climb it for themselves, as you look on, left behind, and uninspired.

We come up with a lot of excuses for our failure to climb. It’s not our fault after all, the mountain was put there by something else. Someone else. We never asked for this to be here. It’s not fair. No one should have to face a mountain. And yet the mountain lies there, uncaring, and unaffected by our displeasure for it. Mountains remain unmoved by disdain. In fact, they don’t move at all. They are only overcome by those who refuse to let the mountain remain an obstacle.

How then do we begin to climb? I’m sure you would have started already if you knew where or how to begin. It’s certainly unhelpful to be constantly told to begin climbing without any instructions, guides, or necessary equipment. Unfortunately, each mountain is unique. I cannot fully tell you what you need in order to climb it, as you would not be able to do the same for me.

What I can tell you is to start small. One step. As slow as you need. You can rest when you’re tired. You just can’t turn back. The first step might be uncomfortable. It might be lonely. You might begin to doubt that climbing was a good idea at all, or forced to wait there while you figure out where the next step even is. But you will eventually reach the summit. And you will learn that the next mountain is never as daunting as it seems from the ground.
