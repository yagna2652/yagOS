I actually like boring. Boredom implies that anything could have made the moment better but the universe chose to make nothing happen at that moment. Just so that we can complain. It’s like the universe is teasing us when we are getting bored. As if the universe is saying it doesn’t find us important. Is it weird that I never get bored? I don’t know how it feels to be bored. I seem to always find things to do or read or watch. And that’s also why I don’t understand people who get bored or worse the people who complain about getting bored. How can you get bored? You are a human being. There is stuff all around you that you can comprehend and decipher and create and play with. I find it impossible. Only people with no creativity can get bored, I feel. Not saying that I am very creative, but I do possess the art of busying myself with absolutely useless stuff.

Speaking of useless stuff, I have moved away from the bird app. I open it ocassionaly to see what my friends are tweeting about. But that's about it. A massive nudge for this decision was - Elon rebranding it too x(dot)com. I simply don't want to be known as someone who is too active on x(dot)com. Also very few people use twitter to actually write. I wanted to start writing long form. Nothing fancy. Just me reading stuff on the internet and writing here. 

Sometimes I wonder what Kurt Cobain's social media presence would look like. My heart wants to believe that, he is a digital hermit. Like one IG feed post a year of a cardigan that shrank in the dryer and an ironic caption that says "#adulting." He'd get like 7 million likes, and a streetwear brand would make a ₹8000 oversized hoodie that would have the post printed. They would go viral after a paparazzi photo of Jeremy Allen White wearing one (paired with running shortes and sambas) started trending on twitter. Kurt would have no idea that it happened. I admire that. I want a social media presence like that. I actually believe that the whole point social media is to talk about impactful things that people do irl. I want to do things irl.
