a growth-driven product designer, with affinities for all things from programming to musical theatre.  I spend my days trying to make technology more user-friendly. I turn confusing interfaces into user-friendly experiences â€”one frustrated sigh at a time.

with my writings, I will follow a structure. you will find tags on the blogs, which will define the nature of the idea. for eg: if it's just ramblings there will be a ramblings tag. if it's a full blown essay you will find that too.

if you find me peddling a lot of gyan on my blogs, just DM me on twitter saying "STFU bitch, you are just 21. you don't know shit."

Thanks for reading!
